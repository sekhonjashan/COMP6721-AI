Author of this Project is Jashan Singh.

The project is 11-d puzzle solver using different kind of algorithms such as :

1. DFS
2. IDFS
3. BFS
4. A*

The main class of the project is PlayThis.java

Run the main class. The console will ask for the user inputs for initial state of the puzzle 
and then it will ask for the algorithm against which it would run.

BFS and A* runs with 2 types of heuristic each. if BFS or A* are selected , program will ask user input
for the heuristic selection as well.

During the execution nothing is displayed on the screen.

Once the goal test is passed , the files will be generated according to the algorithm selected with the 
data of search path.
